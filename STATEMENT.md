Problem Statement 

The lack of engaging, basic programming applications can hinder the practical understanding of core concepts like
functions, loops, and conditional logic. The problem addressed by this project is the need to create a simple, interactive,
and multi-level console game that effectively demonstrates these fundamental programming constructs through a widely recognized 
challenge: guessing a secret number chosen by the computer.

# Scope of the Project 

The scope of this project is limited to a console-based single-player game implemented solely in Python. The application's functionality is restricted to:

Generating a random integer within predefined ranges (1-5, 1-10, 1-20).

Handling numeric user input for guesses and menu selections.

Enforcing a fixed number of attempts (chances) per level.

Providing basic text-based feedback on the game outcome (win or loss).

The project does not include advanced features like graphical user interfaces (GUI), external database connectivity, 
user authentication, or network/multiplayer capabilities.

# Target Users 

The target users for this project are:

Students/Beginner Programmers: Individuals learning Python fundamentals who want a simple, contained application to understand
functions, control flow, and the random library.

# High-Level Features 

The core functionalities provided by the system include:

Multi-Level Difficulty: Offer three distinct difficulty modes (Level 1, Level 2, Level 3) with increasing number ranges and varying chances.

Game Control Flow: Provide a loop-based main menu that allows selection of a level or graceful exit.

Core Guessing Logic: Implement the mechanism to compare the user's input against the secret random number and manage the attempt count.

Feedback and Resolution: Display clear results, including revealing the secret number upon losing a round.

Casual Console Game Users: Anyone seeking a quick, straightforward digital game requiring simple text input.
